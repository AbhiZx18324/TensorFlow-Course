For this exercise see if you can improve MNIST to 99.5% accuracy or more by adding only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to the model from the  assignment of the previous week. \n\nYou should stop training once the accuracy goes above this amount. It should happen in less than 10 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then you'll need to redesign your callback.\n\nWhen 99.5% accuracy has been hit, you should print out the string \"Reached 99.5% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\n","metadata":{"id":"iQjHqsmTAVLU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras","metadata":{"id":"ZpztRwBouwYp","tags":["graded"],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-01T04:59:00.735775Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-01T04:59:00.736259Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-01T04:59:09.560695Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-01T04:59:00.736228Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-01T04:59:09.559756Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load the data\n\nBegin by loading the data.

During the preprocess step you can apply transformations to the dataset that will be fed into your convolutional neural network.\n\nHere you will apply two transformations to the data:\n- Reshape the data so that it has an extra dimension. The reason for this \nis that commonly you will use 3-dimensional arrays (without counting the batch dimension) to represent image data. The third dimension represents the color using RGB values. This data might be in black and white format so the third dimension doesn't really add any additional information for the classification process but it is a good practice regardless.\n\n\n- Normalize the pixel values so that these are values between 0 and 1. You can achieve this by dividing every value in the array by the maximum.\n\nRemember that these tensors are of type `numpy.ndarray` so you can use functions like [reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) or [divide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.divide.html) to complete the `reshape_and_normalize` function below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"training_images.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-01T05:16:05.623764Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-01T05:16:05.624197Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-01T05:16:05.631464Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-01T05:16:05.624163Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-01T05:16:05.630221Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"execution_count":25,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"(60000, 28, 28)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# GRADED FUNCTION: reshape_and_normalize\n\ndef reshape_and_normalize(images):\n    \n    ### START CODE HERE\n\n    # Reshape the images to add an extra dimension\n    images = images.reshape((images.shape[0],images.shape[1],images.shape[2],1))\n    \n    # Normalize pixel values\n    images = images/255.0\n    \n    ### END CODE HERE\n\n    return images","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-01T05:16:53.893772Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-01T05:16:53.894155Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-01T05:16:53.899913Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-01T05:16:53.894123Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-01T05:16:53.898757Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Test your function with the next cell:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reload the images in case you run this cell multiple times\n(training_images, _), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(path='mnist.npz') \n\n# Apply your function\ntraining_images = reshape_and_normalize(training_images)\n\nprint(f\"Maximum pixel value after normalization: {np.max(training_images)}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Shape of training set after reshaping: {training_images.shape}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Shape of one image after reshaping: {training_images[0].shape}\")\n","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-01T05:16:54.435776Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-01T05:16:54.436502Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-01T05:16:54.964248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-01T05:16:54.436466Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-01T05:16:54.963139Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Maximum pixel value after normalization: 1.0\n\nShape of training set after reshaping: (60000, 28, 28, 1)\n\nShape of one image after reshaping: (28, 28, 1)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Expected Output:**\n```\nMaximum pixel value after normalization: 1.0\n\nShape of training set after reshaping: (60000, 28, 28, 1)\n\nShape of one image after reshaping: (28, 28, 1)\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Defining your callback\n\nNow complete the callback that will ensure that training will stop after an accuracy of 99.5% is reached:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# GRADED CLASS: myCallback\n### START CODE HERE\n\n# Remember to inherit from the correct class\nclass myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n    # Define the method that checks the accuracy at the end of each epoch\n    def on_epoch_end(self,epochs,logs = {}):\n        if logs.get('accuracy') >= .995:\n            print(\"\\nReached 99.5% accuracy so cancelling training!\")\n            self.model.stop_training = True\n\n### END CODE HERE\n","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-01T05:32:51.341533Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-01T05:32:51.341960Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-01T05:32:51.347702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-01T05:32:51.341929Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-01T05:32:51.346955Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Convolutional Model\n\nFinally, complete the `convolutional_model` function below.
